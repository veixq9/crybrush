# Goya

A pixel-art editor built on ClojureScript and [Om](https://github.com/swannodette/om). It was largely inspired by the suprisingly short
code snippet required to implement undo functionality in David Nolen's [Time Travel blog post]
(http://swannodette.github.io/2013/12/31/time-travel/).

Play with it here:
